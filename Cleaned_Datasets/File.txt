I have stored only the cleaned versions of both datasets in this repository:

For the Car dataset, the analysis is in Car_Data_Analysis.ipynb and the cleaned version is saved as cleaned_dataset.csv.

For the Laptop dataset, the analysis is in Laptop_Data_Analysis.ipynb and the cleaned version is saved as Laptop_Dataset.csv.

However you can download the original version from the ipynb lab or from the Browser
